3D-PCA streamlit app instructions:
Data preparation:
You need a “feature table” csv file, e.g., the one exported from MZmine for GNPS FBMN. In this file, leave only the first column (row ID) and the samples columns and delete or other columns. Rename the file and save it somewhere.
You also need a metadata csv file, like the one you used in GNPS. But make sure that the order of samples (first column) is the same as the order in the “feature table” file. You may need to change the order. Save it with a different name somewhere.
Features:
Interactive 3D-PCA plot (rotate, enlarge etc).
Interactive Feature loadings plot.
Tables with PCA scores, Feature loadings, Transposed data.
Download plots/tables.
